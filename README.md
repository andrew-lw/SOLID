SOLID - Object Oriented Programming
=====================================

> In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable

The principals listed below are the SOLID principles of object oriented programming (OOP). They are not an exhaustive set but many consider them the pillars of OOP. With any principle two things are present : a guideline to follow or adhere to and a consistent approach. So it is with SOLID. By adhering to the patterns laid out in each principle higher quality software can be the expected result. 

* S - [Single Responsibility Principle](#Single Responsibility)
* O - [Open/Closed Principle](#Open / Closed)
* L - [Liskov Substitution Principle](#Liskov Substitution)
* I - [Interface Segregation Principle](#Interface Segregation)
* D - [Dependency Inversion](#Dependency Inversion)
